As per the authors introduction, the following rules must be followed:
- Type in all of the code. Do not copy-paste!
- Type the code in exactly, even the comments.
- Get it to run and make sure it prints the same output.
- If there are bugs fix them.
- Do the extra credit but it's alright to skip ones you can't figure out.
- Always try to figure it out first before trying to get help.
