print("Welcome to Moonbase Adventure. This is a text adventure game. If you've never played a game like this before, here are a few tips:\n\n1) You play text adventure games by typing what you want to do, then hitting 'enter'. In this game, for the sake of simplicity, commands are only one word long. So, for instance, if you wanted to walk towards the west, you'd simply type 'west' then hit enter. \n\n2) A big part of the fun of these games is discovering the commands. So there is no master list. It's a puzzle game after all! But if you really don't know what to do, try entering 'help'.\n\n")
